A Fighter's Warning
==================================

Darkness lies upon the soul --
Of he who quests with selfish goals --
To steal from deep the riches old --
The magic powers and hoards of gold --
Forgetting his honor which is his trade --
For simple wealth brought home by his blade --
He must cover the land and journey the sea --
To go afar and truly be --
Free of mind and strong of will --
Ready to die and ready to kill --
For that which he knows to be proper --
A deed is not done a word is not said --
That fails to define the path he has lead --
From every kind word to the most evil sin --
From the very first loss to the most recent win --
A figher's no more than the things he has done --
Not the kings whom he knows or the riches he's won --
To travel the world its breadth and its length --
He must find honor knowledge dignity and strength --
Or else be a pawn no will of his own --
Belonging to money or a king on a throne --
Until he controls his fear --
But what is a quest with out riches won --
Without glory of battle in the new morning's dawn --
Yet more there must be in the warrior's eyes --
If he's to know his true self on the day that he dies --
For glory there is in the riches within --
Found only through struggle again again --
Through battles lost and lessons learned --
And blows to the head that were painfully earned --
To remind him well his place in not set --
And his one greatest challenge is yet to be met --
To master the world from within
